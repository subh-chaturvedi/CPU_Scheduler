# Python based simulation of CPU Schedulers

The python script prints Gantt Chart asper process details (input by user) in the format:
```

Gantt:  (0)| P3 (1)|  (2)| P0 (3)| P2 (4)| P1 (7)|

```

Also, ATAT & AWT are calculated for the CPU Simulation

Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority are supported parameters for each process.

Currently implemented:
1. First-Come First-Serve Algorithm
2. Shortest Job First Algorithm
3. Priority Queue Algorithm
